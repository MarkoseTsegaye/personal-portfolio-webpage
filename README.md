**Tech Used**
Django-cotton: Enables me to efficiently create and reuse UI components. Embracing a modular design system simplifies workflows and enhances productivity.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs quickly by using predefined classes directly in their HTML.
Project Structure
The project follows a simple but effective structure that is common for React applications.

Portfolio/templates/cotton: contains the django-cotton components used as the building blocks of the Django application. Each component is built and managed separately allowing an easy integration into one application.
Portfolio/static: houses all the static files such as CSS files and images/media.
